# Jedi Jungle Jam (Java Game)
A simple Java endless runner game. Developed during the evenings of a single week and after only 3 weeks of learning Java, as part of bootcamp-wide Game Jam.

You can download the built jar version directly, published here: https://itch.io/jam/game-jam-4/rate/2327754

Otherwise, you can clone this repo and build it yourself, while taking a gander at our very early and undeveloped (at the time) so-called "spaghetti code".
