# Jedi Jungle Jam (Java Game)
A simple Java endless runner game. Developed during the evenings of a single week and after only 3 weeks of learning Java, as part of bootcamp-wide Game Jam.

You can download the built jar version directly, published here: https://itch.io/jam/game-jam-4/rate/2327754

Otherwise, you can clone this repo and build it yourself, while taking a gander at our very early and undeveloped (at the time) so-called "spaghetti code".

## About the Game

An endless runner based on what we imagine our Jedi's morning routine to be like.

Beware. It's Dark Souls levels of impossible. Hitboxes are merciless. 

Fun fact: the voice clip when the player dies is as much a statement about the player's performance as it is about game's quality itself. 

Controls:

- Press Space to start/restart;
- Press Space to jump;
- Press G to invert gravity
- Hold Down/Up to crouch (depending on gravity orientation)
- Press Q to quit;
- Press K to kill your character and end the game earlier. It would end up like that eventually.

Have fun. Or try to, at least!
